## General Information
- **Background:** The project arises from the need of BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, to understand factors affecting bike demand in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
- **Business Problem:** BoomBikes aims to enhance their business strategy to increase revenue by accurately predicting bike demand and adjusting their services accordingly.
- **Dataset:** The dataset utilized for this analysis is a daily record of bike rentals in the US, featuring various independent variables like temperature, weather conditions, user types, and more.

## Conclusions
- **Significant Variables:** The analysis revealed that weather conditions and seasonal factors significantly influence bike demand.
- **Model Performance:** The multiple linear regression model achieved an R-squared value indicating a strong correlation between the independent variables and bike demand.
- **Residual Analysis:** Residual plots showed that the assumptions of linear regression were met, confirming the validity of the model.
- **Business Insights:** Recommendations were made for BoomBikes to focus on weather and seasonal trends to optimize bike availability and marketing strategies.
